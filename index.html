									<p>This project focuses on American Sign Language (ASL) detection using MediaPipe for real-time hand landmark detection, converting gestures into numpy arrays for LSTM input. The LSTM network processes sequential hand data to recognize ASL signs accurately. Features include real-time sign detection with immediate feedback, model training and evaluation capabilities, and a user-friendly GUI for easy interaction. The system provides a robust solution for real-time ASL interpretation and is open for contributions to enhance its accuracy and functionality.</p>

									<p>Implementing a parking spot detection system using Python and OpenCV. The system processes video footage to identify and highlight available parking spots in real-time, displaying counts of free spaces. It includes scripts for manual selection of parking spots on an image and processing of a video feed to mark and annotate parking spot occupancy. The project aims to facilitate efficient parking management through automated spot detection, enhancing user convenience and operational efficiency.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/ayushieee/Facial-Recognition-System-using-SNN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="image fit"><img src="2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project implements face recognition using a Siamese Neural Network trained on image pairs. It includes scripts for data collection (`train.py`), model training with TensorFlow/Keras, and custom layer definitions (`layers.py`). The trained model is used in `faceid.py` to verify input images from a webcam against a set of verification images. The system requires Python 3.7.9, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Kivy, and provides a comprehensive workflow from data collection to real-time face recognition.</p>
